# DriveNex Android (Compose)

This directory contains a minimal Android app scaffold that integrates the DriveNex UI components and stubs so it compiles.

## Build

Use Android Studio (Giraffe+).

1. Open this folder (`/workspace/drivenex-android`) in Android Studio
2. Let Gradle sync
3. Run the `app` configuration on a device/emulator

## Notes
- Payment uses a simulated 3s delay.
- Many managers/services are stubs to allow compilation. Replace with real implementations.
- Minimum SDK 24, target/compile 34.
